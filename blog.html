                <p>Light, fast, reliable, and efficient. These are the words we would like to incorporate in every development that we are building. Giving rich content while dynamically interactive with its user. Reactjs is a library develop and has enormous support with Facebook. A front-end library that gives a cross-platform in every resolution sizes as possible from web browser to windows desktop, also thru react-native they had developed a mobile-native environment for android and ios apps. Though others may say that no software language fits it all or no one tool can grasp all the solution needed in integrating the front-end to the back-end development. </p>
                <p>The clever side of reactjs is it uses its lifecycles method for multiple API calls to the backend. Whether it’s java, PHP, nodeJS, or  ASP.NET these backend programs that run in a large enterprise such as a bank, government institution, and even our health care infrastructure can integrate well from reactjs library. From validation to authentication reactjs can handle it with the help of a third party library which is redux that not acts only a state managing container but also a middleware as well. You can do both server-side routings but also client-side routing thru react-router. Performing complex CRUD operation thru API fetch and API post is seamless with reactjs. </p>

                <hr>
                <p>In our modern-day web technology, we often hear that our recent hardware capabilities have taken a giant leap that makes the Apollo 11 onboard computer a piece of transistor component in comparison with our modern mobile processors. This Apollo 11 onboard computer has helped the astronaut not only precisely pinpointing the exact coordinate were to land on the moon and also how they could go back on earth safely. We have this kind processor on our mobile devices 100,000 times more powerful and precise on calculating every application we interact with. Yet we still need to utilize the power of the processor and its memory if we were to develop a web or an app in our desktop and mobile application.</p>
                <p>When Facebook releases its frontend library called ReactJS it became a game-changer. Together with its counterpart the NodeJS backend, it gives every platform of choice not only in terms of speed also efficient handling of processor and memory. ReactJS has it what we call virtual Document Object Model (DOM) it first renders the UI in the browser though it also means using your device memory. Then whatever changes happen it would track down those changes and reflect it in the browser skipping the process of re-rendering the whole browser. This made the whole process efficient and in every button, interfaces, and inputs; it has is a single component that has it’s own logic and document manipulation on it. Then pairing it with NodeJS which is a javascript runtime built on google chromes’ V8 engine. NodeJS has non-blocking methods execute asynchronously which makes it lightweight and efficient. Asynchronous means that our operation is processed continuously without needing to wait for another process to finishes in this case NodeJS call it an event loop. It makes the CRUD operation which relates to create, read, update, and delete process to REST API stands for (representational state transfer application programming interface) fast and efficient. Lastly being deployed in Amazon Web Services means having an unlimited scale, assurance of reliability, and maximal utilization of resources.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>We have a KISS principle which translates to Keep It Simple Stupid in software development. To be honest it also a useful principle in designing a user interface and user experience. </p>
                <p>UX or user experience design is a design based concept where the feel and experience of the user is the priority. We can make any app to be user friendly or idiot-proof concept. Easy to navigate, seamless transition, and concise pattern that even a kid could easily follow. </p>
                <p>UI or user interface design is the richest and dynamic visual aspect of any application. From color variation to the utmost color combination once a catchy design relieves each of one's eye. We focus on more simple yet had a greater impact on our user.</p>
                <p>Having a fast, lightweight, and rich UI in the front end. Whether it’s just for a small e-commerce platform to big enterprise infrastructure even in a national government system our aim still to be fast, reliable, and secure.</p>
